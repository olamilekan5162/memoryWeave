## Why MemoryWeave? ü§î

In a world overflowing with digital photos and videos, our memories often get lost in the scroll. MemoryWeave offers a unique solution to not just store, but _re-experience_ and _share_ these precious moments in a deeply personal and engaging way.

- **Craft Immersive Narratives:** Don't just show photos; tell the story. Combine your media with journaling, thematic music, and ambient sounds to reconstruct the _feeling_ of a memory.
- **Your Personal Touch:** With features like custom visual themes (e.g., Vintage, Golden Hour), the Ken Burns effect for photos, and fine-tuned audio mixing, you are the director of your memory experience.
- **All Your Memories, Always Yours:** MemoryWeave operates entirely in your browser. All your data is stored locally using IndexedDB, ensuring privacy and ownership. No cloud accounts, no subscriptions.
- **Share Your Woven Memories:** Export your crafted "Vibes" as JSON files to back them up or share them with other MemoryWeave users. Or, export a fully self-contained HTML 'Mini-Site' of your Vibe that anyone can view in their browser, no app needed!")\_
